Reviewer Tropes
===============

Scientific knowledge progresses mainly through the publication of scientific papers, themselves submitted to the unforgiving process of **peer review**.

Computer Science is no exception, with the majority of its publications going through reviewers in journals and conferences. However, it appears we computer scientists are especially good at being **nasty** reviewers, as Bertrand Meyer [pointed out](https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/123611-the-nastiness-problem-in-computer-science/fulltext) almost ten years ago. As authors, we all have been witnesses or victims of reviews containing objections and criticisms that are abusive, thinly justified, or even just plain wrong. Since our reviewing system often gives the [last word](Last-word) to the reviewers, we are often forced to take these objections silently and soldier on.

This [wiki](https://github.com/sylvainhalle/reviewer-tropes/wiki) is an inventory of what are called **tropes**; a trope is defined as a "commonly recurring literary and rhetorical device, motif or clich√© in creative works". Paper reviews arguably count as creative works in their own right; therefore, this wiki lists the commonly occurring sophisms, boilerplate criticisms and suspicious arguments an ill-intentioned referee could serve to unsuspecting authors.

The tropes are purposefully written in a sardonic style, in the form of short _advice_ in order to sink a paper through various tactics. However, beyond giving people a good laugh by recognizing themselves in one of these entries, it is hoped this wiki could also be used as an informal guide to reviewers, PC chairs and editors alike, so that they can call a suspicious behavior when they see it:

- "Spike, your criticism of the experimental section looks like [trend denial](https://github.com/sylvainhalle/reviewer-tropes/wiki/Trend-denial); could you be more specific about the issues you raise?"
- "Glenda, I'd like you to justify why you think the datasets used are not [representative of the real world](https://github.com/sylvainhalle/reviewer-tropes/wiki/Real-world). Does the [absence of a user study](https://github.com/sylvainhalle/reviewer-tropes/wiki/No-people-involved) really undermine the paper's contribution?"
- "Alfred, your negative criticism of the paper is a rewording of the author's threats to validity. Don't you think this is a case of [regrettable honesty](https://github.com/sylvainhalle/reviewer-tropes/wiki/Regrettable-honesty)?"
- "We understand Reviewer 2's concern about the [large number of examples](https://github.com/sylvainhalle/reviewer-tropes/wiki/Too-much), but were asked in a previous round of revisions to add more; this places us in a [P and not P](https://github.com/sylvainhalle/reviewer-tropes/wiki/P-and-not-P) situation."

## Important warning

This wiki is **humorous** and **ironic** on purpose. I **do not encourage** reviewers to employ any of these "tactics" (nor do I consciously use them myself); the intent is rather to make people (authors, reviewers and chairs) aware of the various slippages, half-truths and unwarranted conclusions that can sometimes creep into paper reviews.
